    23rd February 2018<br><br>

		Dr. Ansgar Reiners is a researcher working on discovery of exoplanets using
		radial velocity. He was one of the co-authors of the paper that announced
		the discovery of Proxima Centauri b in June 2016, which has caused quite
		a lot of excitement in the astronomical community. Dr. Reiners has worked
		on various areas in astrophysics, including stellar astrophysics, in which
		he explored the characteristics of various types of stars, and on exoplanets
		around M-dwarfs. He is currently the managing director of the Institute of
		Astrophysics, University of Gottingen. He delivered a talk on his research on
		radial-velocity based search of exoplanets at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics,
		Bangalore on 23rd February 2018. Our junior researcher Suryoday Basak was able to
    catch up with him and ask him a few questions on the growing area of
		exoplanetary research.
<br><br>

<b><font color="blue">Suryoday Basak</font></b>: How were you drawn towards astronomy
and astrophysics, and in exoplanets in particular? I have seen a some of your papers
which are focused on computation, some which are focused on stars, and some on
exoplanets. So how did you get here?
<br><br>

<b><font color="red">Ansgar Reiners</font></b>: I really came from the physics side.
I'm interested in physics. In general, of course, everyone is excited about the
universe and astronomical objects and similar stuff, but that was not really my
motivation to start with. In physics, I was doing stellar astrophysics, which I
found exciting because you can learn a lot about physics by studying stars. There
are a lot of big experiments set up in the sky: we just have to observe them. That's
something I was fascinated by. I sort of moved in my career, the way down from hot
stars, to sun-like stars, to cooler stars. Often, the research on stars is motivated
by the question, "are we alone?" and "are there other planets out there?" So that
sort of came together. We did the magnetic-field measurements in M-dwarfs, and I
did a lot of research on spectroscopic investigations of low-mass stars. There I
gained some experience in the spectroscopic work with M-stars.
<br><br>

<b><font color="blue">Suryoday Basak</font></b>: So presumably, because you were
involved in research on low-mass stars, you came towards finding planets around them?
<br><br>

<b><font color="red">Ansgar Reiners</font></b>: Yeah, at the time that I worked
on those stars, they became more popular! They were completely unpopular for a
long time. I worked on them together with some colleagues and we collected a lot
of information, which was also at the time when they were becoming popular to look
for exoplanets around them. We had the experience of how they are looking
spectroscopically and this is what's needed to find these exoplanets. So this came
together, and it is not very difficult to be drawn into this business because it's
really exciting.
<br><br>

<b><font color="blue">Suryoday Basak</font></b>: Could you tell us about the main
challenges faced in the pipeline? I'm not enquiring only about the instrumentation
aspect of it, because, sure, there's a really big technological challenge and the
general opinion is that we're all improving, but tell us more about handling the
machinery and getting the computation done.
<br><br>

<b><font color="red">Ansgar Reiners</font></b>: All the observations are done at
the observatory. There's a quick-look pipeline at the mountain, which is similar
to the pipeline we have, but it's just for a quick look by the observers. So there
are actually staff observers in Spain. The data is transferred to our institute
and we have all the data on a local machine. Then there's a pipeline reducing the
data. There's one person looking at the pipeline every day but it is running
automatically. So we're observing essentially every night. This cannot be done
by hand. If that person is on vacation, you're lost, and it's just way too boring
for him. With lots of data, you also need to have a consistency with your data
analysis, and this is sort of a 'machine' thing. So this runs automatically and
there's a person looking at it, just checking whether everything is great. When
it works out, it's fine, we store the data.
<br><br>

Pretty much every two months, we do a re-analysis of the radial velocities. The
analysis is a two-step process. First, you have these 2D spectra and from that,
you have to make a 1D spectra: basically representing the magnitude as a time series.
So you have these spectra - that's the first step, and then from that, you have
to have these radial velocities based on the Doppler shift: that's the second
part of the pipeline. All this needs to be done consistently for the entire dataset
every two months.
<br><br>

Then the data goes into archives. People download the data and look at it. The
team looks at the individual objects and if we find something interesting going on,
it goes in a list. We then assign people to individual targets who then look at
them in detail, and find out what is going on, and whether there's really an exoplanet.
<br><br>

<b><font color="blue">Suryoday Basak</font></b>: After having gained some insights
from your own research on how exoplanets are, can you comment on their
characterization? I know that at this point in time that's a dicey question but
I'd like to know how we can reasonably characterize or group a lot of exoplanets
from different solar systems into categories.
<br><br>

<b><font color="red">Ansgar Reiners</font></b>: There are generally two different
approaches. One is that you understand the planets as a group, which means that
you look at the entire crowd of planets that are known and you do statistical
analysis. You ask the question of how many planets of a certain mass exist around
a star of a certain mass; add a distance, eccentricity and all the parameters that
you have. By now we have more than a few thousand planets so this already gives
nice answers! There's also a lot of stuff coming out about formation, evolution
and all these kinds of things.
<br><br>

That's one side. It doesn't tell you a lot about the planet itself, it just gives
you some information about the parent stars and their existence. About the
exoplanets themselves: there are mainly the spectroscopy-based approaches. So if
you have a transiting planet, then from it you can learn more. From this, you can
get the radius and the atmospheric characterization. And that is one of the reasons
why these missions are so successful. We've had Kepler and Corot, and we'll have
CHEOPS, TESS, and Plato in the future. These are all satellite missions and there's
a huge investment in this high number of missions for this one particular target.
All this is for finding transiting planets because that's the way towards
characterizing them.
<br><br>

<b><font color="blue">Suryoday Basak</font></b>: I suppose that I have one last
question for you. What you see to as future of this field, maybe five to ten years
down the line?
<br><br>

<b><font color="red">Ansgar Reiners</font></b>: Well, we will have a lot more
planets known. The whole picture will be much better drawn, much better painted.
<br><br>

<b><font color="blue">Suryoday Basak</font></b>: And I suppose that at that point
of time a very robust characterization scheme would be necessary?
<br><br>

<b><font color="red">Ansgar Reiners</font></b>: Yeah, the characterization is one
thing. Though, the study of exoplanet atmospheres is also becoming strong; there
are missions for exoplanet atmospheres and all the elements that you can find.
This is all super exciting: to know what they do, and whether the atmospheres are
expanding and how they react to different environments! All this will be figured out.
<br><br>

Two specific questions that I find exciting that will be addressed in the future are,
first, there's a prediction from planet-formation models that around one solar mass
stars there's a maximum number of planets. We've found a lot of Jupiters, we know
that M-dwarfs don't have hot Jupiters, but there is a lot of M-dwarfs, and they have
a lot of Earth-like planets. That's what we know. And they are `supposed' to have a
lot of those! We hope to find many of those planets with different missions and
see if this prediction is actually true regarding planet formation. The second
thing is that many radial-velocity surveys are now running long enough to find
sizable samples of planets that are similar to the planets in our solar system
and ask the question whether the planets in our solar system are some weirdos
or just planets like all the others. There are some people that say that our
system is really an exception. I'm not sure I buy that because there's a huge
bias in the entire idea and in all the observations that we have done. If we go
on observing for a few more years, maybe ten years or so, several surveys would
have run long enough to find these Jupiters and Saturns. And if we find those,
then why not look for copies of our solar system? And how many of such systems
exist? This is a really important question.
