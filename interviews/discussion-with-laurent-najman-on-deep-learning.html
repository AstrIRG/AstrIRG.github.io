    30th December 2017<br><br>

		Dr. Laurent Najman is a professor of computer science at the University
		of Paris and Laboratoire d'Informatique Gaspard-Monge. Throughout his
		career, he has worked on the applications of image processing and
		computer vision in varous areas including military, medicine, and astronomy.
		Dr. Najman has published over 200 scholarly articles, including the book
		book Mathematical Morphology, which he co-authored with Hugues Talbot.
		He was a keynote speaker at the International Conference on
    Advances in Pattern Recognition (ICAPR), 2017 held in the Indian Statistical
    Institute, Bangalore. Our junior researcher Suryoday Basak was able to
    catch up with him and ask him a few questions on the advent of deep
    learning and how data science will eventually come to be an omnipresent
		driving force for emerging areas of science.
<br><br>
<b><font color="blue">Suryoday Basak</font></b>: You have worked on a lot of
interdisciplinary projects, ranging from image processing in medicine,
military, and even astrophysics. What do you see as the future of data
science? And what impact does deep learning have on the way things are
done today?

<br><br>
<b><font color="red">Laurent Najman</font></b>: Deep learning is really
shifting what we're doing today in computer vision at large. There has been
a 'before' and there will be an 'after' — there is a change in the way we're
doing things today. We can't ignore computational or machine learning in
general. What I think is that, progressively, machine or computational
learning will be just a
commodity. I don't believe that everything can be solved with the
techniques we have today but one problem that deep learning solves
is the computation or extraction of features. This is a very important
problem by itself. We need to analyze features in data anyway, and for this,
most of the things that we are doing today in computational learning, in general, can be
used to analyze features. I think this is something very generic, I mean it's
true not only for computer vision but true for many fields. For example, in
the biggest conference for radiologists, held in early last June, one of the
keynote speeches was on how the radiologists as we know them today are going
to disappear. And why? This is because today, the physician, let's say, a
cardiologist, doesn't need the opinion of a radiologist on images; as the
technologies are maturing, any cardiologist is able to read and understand the
medical images by himself or herself. There's no need for the opinion of
anyone else! What the radiologists can do now is to expand their knowledge
and to do the 'science' — to analyze not only the image data but any sort of
data that we have procured from patients and then maybe they can form an
informed opinion on something new. This is something that the practising cardiologist will
never do because she will never have time to do that. So data science will
progressively invade every aspect of our lives [laughs]! But it's not only
computational learning but also visualizing, analyzing, and a lot of other
things with the data that we have to do. I can't really imagine what the
possibilities are — they are numerous! So my opinion is that we need to know
a few things about deep learning. We definitely need to understand what the
technology is doing. At the moment, we don't know. We just know it works,
but that is not enough. It's not a science if it works and we don't know why.
And more importantly, we don't know when it fails! We need to know when it
fails. At the same time, we will always have a need for the basic techniques
because they can be used on top of deep learning.

<br><br>
<b><font color="blue">Suryoday Basak</font></b>: So deep learning actually
hides a lot of details which are otherwise fed by scientists who have worked
on computer vision. Does deep learning really automate the process of
classification without prior feature extraction?

<br><br>
<b><font color="red">Laurent Najman</font></b>: At this stage of research, we
don't know what deep learning is doing. No one knows, but people are trying
to understand. You can look at a feature provided by any type of deep learning
algorithm. You can look at them and you can see that at low levels, they are
definitely very similar to wavelets and similar stuff, something that a human
can engineer. Humans can find low-level features but here they are detected
automatically. So they may be a little better; I don't know, but maybe you
don't need to care. At the higher levels of deep
learning machinery, we don't understand exactly what happens. It's not
possible at this stage. There's no explanation of how they combine and what
they are doing in the end. So deep learning is a way to transform data from
one space to another space where it's easier to classify. And it does the job
very well! But for the moment, there's no theory that allows us to explain
the features that are provided by deep neural networks and this is something
that we have to work on.


<br><br>
<b><font color="blue">Suryoday Basak</font></b>: That really provides a
clearer perspective on why deep learning is taking over. I suppose that if you
don't need to really worry about feature extraction, a lot of your work is
taken care of! My last question for you is from a different viewpoint of your
work. As you've worked on various interdisciplinary projects, could you
elaborate on the attitude of scientists from domains other than computer
science towards the advent of machine learning and deep learning? Working on
astroinformatics, it's often observed that there's an inherent cultural
difference between physicists and computer scientists, where the former might
be bent on using one set of, say, four to five features for an elaborate
analysis, whereas the latter might make use of all features to do an object
classification. In your experience, how did you overcome such barriers of
discipline and mindset?
<br><br>
<b><font color="red">Laurent Najman</font></b>: It is usually difficult to work
with people from other domains at first because they might not have any
knowledge of what we are doing in our field, and there is a first stage where
we have to understand each other. It is very important to have an understanding.
For example, in one of my projects, we had to do a tumor segmentation and
measurement from images. At the beginning of the project, there were ups and
downs in our collaboration with the physicians because at some level, they did
not understand what we're doing. But at the end when we presented the final
project, they were totally baffled! So now we have a very good salesman who
is a doctor and he's totally bought the idea! He's also selling the product,
for free [laughs]! He's sharing it with anyone who collaborates with us and
wants it to become 'the' software in the field to standardize the research in
the area of tumor segmentation.
<br><br>
Indeed, it is difficult to communicate if you don't understand each other.
This requires human qualities, tenacity, and also showing a lot of examples
demonstrating that your technology works. Trust is an important matter when
you start a project. Eventually, people can understand what's going on.
Taking the example that you mentioned: okay, someone is working with a few
features, but this is because they think that these features are important.
If you can do some kind of statistical analysis to find what features are
more important, I think you can show the effectiveness of your methods.
